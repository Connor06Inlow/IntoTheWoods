        <p>You decided to run, good choice... or was it? You cant see so you cant run that fast as you dont know whats around you. Your friends catch up and they are exhausted but you guys keep pushing until you realize you are lost in the woods with nothing but a cell phone with no service, a dead flashlight , and no help. What could go wrong? Well unfortunately, bigfoot was waiting for all of you to fall into his trap so he can eat you. You all are now done for, im sorry.

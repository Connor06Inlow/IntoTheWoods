        So you ran away, wimps. You all make it out of the woods perfectly fine and get back to your house. When you get home your mom is waiting for you and you tell her everything that happened and everyone has a good laugh. Your friends and you decide to go to bed but you see something outside the window. It's the figure again. Are you really safe?<br>

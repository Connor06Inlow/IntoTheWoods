        Wow you're brave, going into the dark against something that you dont even know is real! What if it was just your imagination? now you're in too deep with no flashlight and just you and your friends. So you and your friends can take on what ahead? Lets see. As you aproach the water you see it again. But this time its small and furry. You get closer and closer until you realize it was just a rabbit running around in cirlces. You and your friends laugh and make jokes as you head back out of the woods. Maybe if you would have just ran out as you saw it something else would have happened, want to to try again?<br>
